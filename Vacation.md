# We All Needed a Day Off
On a sunny and **way too hot** Saturday in July, my friends and I pretended we didn't have the stresses of the coming work week and lived like we once again had a three month Summer vacation.



## First on the Agenda: Swimming
We all know how packed the beaches can get around this time, so we decided to head up to Moulton Falls and cool off as best we could.

## My Little Interlude
It isn't a vacation for me unless I can sneak away and get a little "me" time. This time I snuck away to my favorite coffee shop [Southeast Grind](http://southeastgrind.com/) and read a little bit of Allen Ginsberg's [_Howl_](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl).

## Time for food...of course

As the day came to a close and the sun started to set, we decided to hit our favorite spot, Mark's on the Channel, to grab some drinks and enjoy the company of some adventurous sea creatures.

> Not pictured: Pan fried oysters, market pasta with shrimp, sriracha and garlic batter fried cod, and plenty of fries to go around. If you haven't been to Mark's on the Channel before, trust me: it will immediately shoot to the top of your list of favorite seafood places!

[Here's a link](https://marksonthechannel.com/) to their website if you're at all interested. Just a heads up: their market menu changes every day, so be prepared!

## All good things must come to an end...

After a solid three hours of drinks, food, and laughs, we decided to head back for a fire at my friend's house. This is my favorite way to end any day, especially one filled with so many fun activities and great company. Some of us called it a night shortly after the fire got started, while the rest of us waited to see the sun, along with our forgotten responsibilities, rise above the horizon.

## What makes for your _"perfect"_ day?

For me, I know that any of combination of these will make me satisfied with how I spent my time:

* Time with friends/family
* New/good music
* Trying a new restaurant
* Going on a new hike
* Any time spent writing/reading


# The End
Thank you for reading my recap of a random day in July! I hope you enjoyed it!
